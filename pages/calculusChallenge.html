      <h2>Calculus - 30 days challenges</h2>

      <p>Day 1: Solid of Revolution, learning about Area / Volume / Disk</p>

      <p>
        So far, we know that area can be found by getting
        <quote>Base x height</quote>, this can be done with calculus by getting
        the width of the individual rectangle and multiply the f(x), but to make
        it accurate we use the integral formula to make it shorter as well, so,
        Integration of A(x) = Delta X * f(x) dx , the same go with the volume
        here, we can get volume by using integration of A(x) to our desire
        volume.
      </p>
      <p>Day 2: Solid of Rev, Klasher Method</p>
      <p>
        Klasher method method in finding the volume of two by taking the outside
        minus the inside
      </p>
      <p>Day 3: Arc Length</p>
      <p>
        Uses a formula of lineralization by using the reiman sum of the
        equation. Just like above the solid or revolution in which can be rotate
        in any area or axis in which Lineralization applies the same way.
      </p>
      <p>Day 4: Exponent trick</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a^-1 = 1/a</li>
        <li>a^1/2 = sqrt(a)</li>
        <li>a^x * a^y = a^(x + y)</li>
        <li>(a^x)^y = a^(x*y)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Day 5: Evaluating Exponent</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When facing an exponential function that is factor: try to evaluate it
          first and then you can find the simplication
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Day 6 (Failed)</p>
      <p>Day 7: Review on Riemann Sum and Approximation</p>
      <p>
        Reviewing the previous work made me realize how stupid i am sometimes, I
        should have read the question 2 or 3 times first before starting doing,
        today I focus on the reviewing the Approximation to see how the width /
        formula works on integration, beside this, I also review back the rule
        of rieman sum as well
      </p>
      <p>Day 8: Continue with Surface Area</p>
      <p>Surface Area = 2pi integration of x * sqrt(1 + derive_of(f(x))) dx</p>
      <p>Day 9: Review back the Test 1</p>
      <p>
        I work on the Rieman Sum and finding Area back, I still have trouble
        visualizing the data and fine which range should i go in
      </p>
      <p>Day 10: Learning the basic of trignometry</p>
      <p>
        Sin angle can be represented as the y value in which as much rotation it
        gives the same value
      </p>
      <p>Day 11: Approximation</p>
      <p>
        Today I am reviewing the approximation on upper sum and lower sum,
        somehow it seems like the upper sum gives much closer value than the
        lower but still I think the midpoint gives even better approximation.
      </p>
      <p>Day 12: Total Area</p>
      <p>
        In calculating the total area between two points or interval, a
        subinterval is necessary, to do we can pair up the equation f(x) to 0,
        and get the points in which will be used as a subinterval
