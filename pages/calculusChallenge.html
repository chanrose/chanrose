      <h2>Calculus - 30 days challenges</h2>

      <p>Day 1: Solid of Revolution, learning about Area / Volume / Disk</p>

      <p>
        So far, we know that area can be found by getting
        <quote>Base x height</quote>, this can be done with calculus by getting
        the width of the individual rectangle and multiply the f(x), but to make
        it accurate we use the integral formula to make it shorter as well, so,
        Integration of A(x) = Delta X * f(x) dx , the same go with the volume
        here, we can get volume by using integration of A(x) to our desire
        volume.
      </p>
      <p>Day 2: Solid of Rev, Klasher Method</p>
      <p>
        Klasher method method in finding the volume of two by taking the outside
        minus the inside
      </p>
      <p>Day 3: Arc Length</p>
      <p>
        Uses a formula of lineralization by using the reiman sum of the
        equation. Just like above the solid or revolution in which can be rotate
        in any area or axis in which Lineralization applies the same way.
